# TRFill
A haplotype-resolved, reference-guided, gap-filling method that specializes in assembling tandem repeats.

Here is a prototype of TRFill without any user friendly port or cookbook, since I am currently too busy to do so. Literally speaking only I can wield it. 

If you are interested in TRFill, please contact me at pants@mail.ustc.edu.cn. Sorry for your troubles. :(
